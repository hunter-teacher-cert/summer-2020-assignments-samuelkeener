What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

**When baffle is invoked, it prints out the word "wug", then calls the ping method.  The ping method simply prints a period, then goes to the next line, so all in all, baffle prints out:
"wug." (then a new line)
When zoop is called, it invokes baffle, then prints "You wugga ", then invokes baffle again.

The output of the main method would be as follows:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.


Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

There aren't any variables in this program, but this is what the method execution looks like by the time it hits the first ping.  It is halfway through baffle, a third of the way through the first call to zoop, and half way through main.
main["No, I" [zoop [baffle "wug" [ping ... 

What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

This will cause an infinite loop, as baffle refers back to ping.
